Hi, I am Akshay Verma.

I am currently doing my Masters in Computer Science from [University at Buffalo, New York](http://grad.buffalo.edu/programs/computer-science-and-engineering-ms.html) with GPA of 3.84. The expected date of graduation is May, 2020.
Two broad areas that excites me the most are **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Vision**.

In the past, I have worked as Tools Development Engineer at Nvidia. This is where I learned the most and fell in love with Python. Over the 3 years I worked in Nvidia, I got to work on different products such as [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/), [Nvidia Shield TV](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/), and [Nvidia Drive Platform for Autonomous Driving](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/self-driving-cars/drive-platform/).

## Skills

As a result of my professional experience and personal curiosity, I have experience in working with multiple technologies. Some of which are listed below:

**Languages**: Python | JavaScript | C | C++ <br><br>
**Tools and Frameworks**: OpenCV | Keras | Elasticsearch | Kibana | Logstash | Apace Kakfa | MySQL | Pandas | Numpy | Scikit-learn | JIRA | GIT | Jupyter <br><br>
**Operating System**: Linux, Android


I am actively looking for internship in the Summer of 2019. If you would like to discuss opportunies or simply talk, feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iakshayverma/) or get in touch via [e-mail](mailto:akshayverma948@gmail.com).
